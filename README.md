# Reporting-ips-and-cve-related-updates

Goal is to get from an online Sharepoint .xlsx file CVEs that people want to follow. Next we analyze them to find any match with 
the updates of ips in the fortiguard lab. If we find any match, we send a mail to the concerned people to warn them with all 
the information.

## Installation

Set-up the credentials for an smtp server. 
launch the local smtp :

```bash
python -m smtpd -c DebuggingServer -n localhost:1025
```

Ask for credentials to connect to the sharepoint file

## Usage

Don't forget the imports

```python
import requests
import configparser
import lxml
import smtplib, ssl
import email
import office365
import io
import pandas
```
